This is where I learn about language. I mostly compile on either window, OSX, ubuntu so you need to re-compile it. The codes are pretty simple but you could learn a lot from their behavior or further using gdb.

I'm completely fine with any copy/clone/fork/join/adjust on most of these (any of mine) files to assist your education. This is completely free of charge and fully open-source. Credit and permission is not needed. HOWEVER, SOME FILES ARE NOT MINE, I put credit comment on top of those files as a reminder, those files license will be different. I will not take any responsibility on your actions on those files.
